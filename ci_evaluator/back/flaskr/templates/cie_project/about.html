    <p class="body">Whether we know it or not, 
      Open Source software is an integral part of todayâ€™s 
      technological development and everyone regularly uses its fruits  
      across the globe. In an effort to contribute to the open source 
      community, we have set out to address an unresolved an unresolved issue: 
      how to properly assess the health of open source projects. 
      <br><br>
      We believe that a healthy project must be constructive and inclusive. 
      The Constructiveness & Inclusiveness Evaluator (CIE) analyzes GitHub project's
      pull requests (PR) and assigns a score to each PR. We are going to measure 
      constructiveness and inclusiveness of each comment in the PR togather with other 
      PR's metadata as was it merged, how long did it take to merge or close it, 
      median response time for comment, etc. 
      <br><br>
      Based on evaluated PRs we are going to assign an overall score to the project. 
      It is our hope that newcomers and experts, startups and corporations, 
      small and large projects, use this tool to 
      <ul>
        <li>better navigate open source community, </li>
        <li>popularize healthy projects,</li> 
        <li>find inclusive projects to contribute to,</li>
        <li>inform their decision-making process.</li>
