  <p class="index-text">
    Whether we know it or not, Open-Source software, such as 
    <ul>
      <li>Linux,</li>
      <li>Kubernetes, </li>
      <li>OpenSSL, </li>
    </ul>  
  </p> 
  <p>and many others, are an integral part of todayâ€™s technological development 
    across the globe. Given our increased dependence on them, we set out to gauge the health of 
    these projects which are founded on community. </p>
    <p class="index-text">We believe that a healthy project must be 
    constructive and inclusive. The <b>Constructiveness & Inclusiveness Evaluator (CIE)</b> 
    tool can be used to analyze a GitHub project. It examines each Pull Request (PR), evaluating 
    its comments and associated meta data such as time from submission to first review, and time 
    from submission to merge. Individual PR scores are combined to assign a project level score. A high 
    scoring project is indicative of a better managed and more sustainable project, one where a newcomer 
    may be more welcome, one that will grow in functionality and support and thus be a better candidate 
    for adoption. </p>
    <p class="index-text">We hope that newcomers and experts, startups, corporations, and foundations, small and large 
    project developers, use  the CIE tool to better navigate the open source community, to inform their 
    decision-making processes with regard to contributing, adopting, and funding open source projects.
  </p>
  <p class="index-text">
    We provide 2 ways of evaluating projects as well as a list of evaluated and stored projects:
    <ul>
      <li>evaluate project by pull request,</li>
      <li>evaluate project by year.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="index-text">
    Since evaluation takes much time and average person is not going to wait that long we encourage 
    you to use pull request evaluation as it can be a sneak peek into the evaluation process in general.
  </p>
  <p class="index-text">
    One of the main features we provide is evaluation by year, which can show how a particular project 
    is changing over time.
