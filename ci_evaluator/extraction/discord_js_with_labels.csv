`VoiceState#suppress` can be `undefined`. This is achieved by not knowing the state of a `GuildMember`'s `VoiceState` upon them joining a voice channel or a stage channel.

This can be reproduced by starting the bot up using the following code:
```JavaScript
const Client = new (require(""discord.js"")).Client({
  intents: [
    ""GUILD_VOICE_STATES""
  ]
});

Client.on(""voiceStateUpdate"", oldState => console.log(oldState));

JavaScript being weakly typed is one of its forces, but also one of its drawbacks (which is why TypeScript was born), but imo it's not up to the library to check for those inputs. If people want to code ""safely"", they can switch to TypeScript, get a good linter, or even better (but maybe a little bit too much) read documentation.

Which is, in fact, an outdated way of creating Webhooks. I wouldn't say we *shouldn't* place it because it's the user's fault, though. Since the options parameter is a string, it cannot append the default arguments, hence producing a misleading error:
`cannot append property shardCount on string ""...""`
I've seen lots of users in the server that have errors like the above. 

Furthermore, this prevents using the wrong data in other parts of client-related things. Some users don't have a proper IDE, hence they won't receive any feedback from the typings either, this does it for the interpreter.

**Status and versioning classification:**
- Code changes have been tested against the Discord API, or there are no code changes
- I know how to update typings and have done so, or typings don't need updating

This throws an error to the user if the `options` provided is not an object. It prevents more confusing and misleading errors given by the process. For example, one may have something like this:
```ts
new WebhookClient('id', 'token');
```

This PR removes applicationCommand events as a Discord developer said they were not meant to be sent to bots (https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/3690#issuecomment-902915187). This can be a semver minor since the events never fired anyway.

Sometimes bots hang while connecting for 15 seconds because 1 single guild is messed up. For bots with Continuous integration, this can create significant impacts to uptime, user experience, and lag.

This adds the optional `fetchGuildTimeout` option under ClientOptions, where the bot developer can optionally specify how long the client should hang for. If not specified, this will remain the default 15 seconds.

Sometimes bots hang while connecting for 15 seconds because 1 single guild is messed up. For bots with Continuous integration, this can create significant impacts to uptime, user experience, and lag.

This adds the optional `fetchGuildTimeout` option under ClientOptions, where the bot developer can optionally specify how long the client should hang for. If not specified, this will remain the default 15 seconds.

I'm happy to discuss how this can be improved, including the names of the options and variables, and I'd also be happy to write documentation!

I completely agree with this not being ready yet, just posting it here for some discussion. I assume most of the animosity in the previous discussion linked above was that *someone* had to do the work, so I decided to just see what happens.

Although I believe v16 is about to be LTS which should mean that both Blob and web streams should be removed from experimental status (?).

> Why not use axios though?

I've never personally used `axios`, so I don't know what - if any - benefits it provides over a standardized fetch API. However, just looking it over I can point out a few things:

- For Node, Axios wraps around http(s) which means it's much slower than undici (see: https://github.com/nodejs/undici/#benchmarks)
- By using a fetch implementation, it means that the API is standardized and, once spec-compliant, unlikely to change in the future.
- I have no idea if `axios` can handle the weird, non-spec compliant @discordjs/formdata package (for that matter, node-fetch v3 removed this behavior as well). Undici provides an implementation for node without external dependencies.
- Undici is maintained by nodejs maintainers under the nodejs organization. It's possible that this might land in core, and there have been talks of doing so. If it lands in core, we can simply remove the `const { fetch } = require('undici');` and it will work without changes.",9,inclusive,inclusive,10,constructive,constructive

> The [Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org) allows users to skip consuming the response body by relying on [garbage collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management#garbage_collection) to release connection resources. Undici does the same. However, garbage collection in Node is less aggressive and deterministic (due to the lack of clear idle periods that browser have through the rendering refresh rate) which means that leaving the release of connection resources to the garbage collector can lead to excessive connection usage, reduced performance (due to less connection re-use), and even stalls or deadlocks when running out of connections. Therefore, it is highly recommended to always either consume or cancel the response body.

Using undici is really living on the edge of experimental apis...
undici is using latest stuff from NodeJS and requires the newest and experimental api's there is... which is still unstable

- Now undici is using [require('node:buffer').Blob](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/9f53d8216cc70f35de14a5f43d73f8608ab98a21/lib/fetch/body.js#L7) and not something else throughout their entire codebase (in fetch & FormData)
- undici created a own [File class](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/main/lib/fetch/file.js) that extends the builtin NodeJS Blob
- And theirs FormData instance requires the input to be nothing but a [instance](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/9f53d8216cc70f35de14a5f43d73f8608ab98a21/lib/fetch/formdata.js#L28-L32) of a NodeJS Blob coming from `node:buffer` 

So no... you can't append a buffer into their FormData instance, you have to construct a File using there version of the File implementation. (or creating a Blob using node:buffer - that later gets upgraded by their FormData impl automatically according to spec)

## About Blobs...

One of the reason why fetch-blob haven't switched to using the built in version of NodeJS Blob impl is b/c they are pretty darn useless unless you can't get them backed up by the filesystem somehow, otherwise they are just useless containers that stores a buffers in memory where you could as well use a uint8array or ArrayBuffer directly instead.

With `fetch-blob` you can get a File from the filesystem without holding anything in the memory. 
something of which node's is looking into implementing https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/37340 But they are blocked by support for async blob sources https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/37338 and also implementing a File class https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39015

Only then when File and blobs backed up by the file system would we over at node-fetch start to consider using the built in impl. and marking fetch-blob as legacy. cuz right now it serves a purpose not even NodeJS have fixed in their version.

## About FormData

Now to the version of undici FormData impl... knowing what i have written earlier about node's wortless Blob container and how strict undici FormData only accept a version of NodeJS own Blob implementation...
Do you think undici dose a grate job at sending large multipart payloads with files embedded up to a few GB of files? the answer is No.
You are required to read all files, construct a new Blob (or a File that extends Blob) with buffers and it's all held in memory.

Unlike one other spec compatible FormData implementations such as [formdata-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formdata-polyfill) it dose not use instanceof checks. It can work with other Blob/File implementations as long as they look like a Blob, so it can accept both a fetch-blob and a NodeJS blob

and it can generate a FormData boundary/payload without ever reading the files content.

undici is more focused on writing something they wish to see being implemented into core one day. not something that is best suitable for userland as they require the latest experimental features 
undici is very new and not as much battle tested as node-fetch

if i would choose between undici and node-fetch then i would _maybe_ go with node-fetch 2.x or 3.x b/c it's 
- supported on more node's versions
- have been tested a lot by many users
- is less strict about what Blob, File, AbortSignal, URLSearchParams and FormData you are using. So it can work with files backed up by filesystem or other implementations cuz it dose not use `instanceof` checks instead uses duck typing to check if it looks like a duck and quack like a duck. This have been a feature of node-fetch since a very long beginning b/c nodejs lacks all those things.",10,inclusive,inclusive,10,constructive,constructive

The reason is that [`DataResolver#resolveFile`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/fe9500538e76423e49e16a1e1756eb04b5f40531/src/util/DataResolver.js#L108) returns a [`ReadableStream`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/webstreams.html) (Web Stream) for a **URL**, as that's what [`Response.body`](https://github.com/nodejs/undici#responsebody) is in undici and a [`ReadStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) (Nodejs Stream) for a **local file path**, as that's what `fs#createReadStream` returns.

Neither of them returns `true` for `Buffer#isBuffer`, hence they can't be converted into a Blob, which results in undici throwing as it expects a Blob as a value in `FormDate#append`.

I did some tinkering and got the `FormData#append` working which results in the bot correctly uploading the attachments. However, <ins>I don't know how **efficient** of an approach it is or what effects it has on the memory</ins>. Still, I'll write down what I did:

1) For a URL, we can directly return `Response.blob()` in [`DataResolver#resolveFile`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/fe9500538e76423e49e16a1e1756eb04b5f40531/src/util/DataResolver.js#L108) :
```js
static async resolveFile(resource) {
  if (typeof resource === 'string') {
    if (/^https?:\/\//.test(resource)) {
      const res = await fetch(resource);
      // return res.body;
      return res.blob();
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```
`Buffer#isBuffer` will return `false` for Blob, hence `toBlob` will pass it as it is to `FormData#append`.

2) For a local file path, we can create a `Buffer` using `fs.readFile`:
```js
static async resolveFile(resource) {
  if (typeof resource === 'string') {
    // ...
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const file = path.resolve(resource);
      fs.stat(file, (err, stats) => {
        if (err) return reject(err);
        if (!stats.isFile()) return reject(new DiscordError('FILE_NOT_FOUND', file));
        return fs.readFile(file, (error, buf) => {
          if (error) return reject(error);
          return resolve(buf);
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
``` 
`toBlob` will then convert this `Buffer` into a Blob",8,inclusive,inclusive,9,constructive,constructive

Removed the dependencies of `node-fetch` and `@discordjs/formdata` in favor of `undici`.

Undici contains spec-compliant `fetch` and `FormData` implementations, is maintained by
NodeJS contributors, and is just basically all around better. [Repo](https://github.com/nodejs/undici)

Complete list of changes:
- Removed `@discordjs/form-data` package and its 4 dependencies.
- Removed `node-fetch` (still installed as a dev package)
- [MessageAttachment](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment) and [MessageAttachment.setFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment?scrollTo=setFile) now accept a `Blob` parameter. 
- Likewise, [DataResolver.resolveFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFile) also accepts a Blob. It also returns a `Blob` now, whereas it used to return a `Buffer` or `ReadableStream`.
- [DataResolver.resolveBase64](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveBase64) now returns `Promise<string>`.
- [DataResolver.resolveFileAsBuffer](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFileAsBuffer) is no longer used anywhere in the code, so like previously unused utility functions, will likely get removed in v14 (if this pr lands).
- The library now requires Node >=16.7.0 (bumped from Node >=16.6.0)

edit: I've been personally using this on my bot (roughly 21,000 members) that has made thousands of http requests and there has been no issue. This PR is likely ready for production use if anyone reading this wants to try it out. ;)

Removed the dependencies of `node-fetch` and `@discordjs/formdata` in favor of `undici`.

Undici contains spec-compliant `fetch` and `FormData` implementations, is maintained by
NodeJS contributors, and is just basically all around better. [Repo](https://github.com/nodejs/undici)

Complete list of changes:
- Removed `@discordjs/form-data` package and its 4 dependencies.
- Removed `node-fetch` (still installed as a dev package)
- [MessageAttachment](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment) and [MessageAttachment.setFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment?scrollTo=setFile) now accept a `Blob` parameter. 
- Likewise, [DataResolver.resolveFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFile) also accepts a Blob. It also returns a `Blob` now, whereas it used to return a `Buffer` or `ReadableStream`.
- [DataResolver.resolveBase64](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveBase64) now returns `Promise<string>`.
- [DataResolver.resolveFileAsBuffer](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFileAsBuffer) is no longer used anywhere in the code, so like previously unused utility functions, will likely get removed in v14 (if this pr lands).
- The library now requires Node >=16.7.0 (bumped from Node >=16.6.0)

edit: I've been personally using this on my bot (roughly 21,000 members) that has made thousands of http requests and there has been no issue. This PR is likely ready for production use if anyone reading this wants to try it out. ;)

```
The Fetch Standard allows users to skip consuming the response body by relying on garbage collection
to release connection resources. Undici does the same. However, garbage collection in Node is less aggressive
and deterministic (due to the lack of clear idle periods that browser have through the rendering refresh rate)
which means that leaving the release of connection resources to the garbage collector can lead to excessive
connection usage, reduced performance (due to less connection re-use), and even stalls or deadlocks when
running out of connections. Therefore, it is highly recommended to always either consume or cancel the 
response body.
```
It seems like an issue with NodeJS itself and not the package. Undici only seems to mention it because it's explicitly stated in the fetch spec. The difference between `node-fetch` and `undici` is that undici attempts to follow the spec whereas node-fetch just doesn't really care. It might also be an underlying implementation because nf uses http(s) and undici uses sockets. ",9,inclusive,inclusive,10,constructive,constructive

- Removed `@discordjs/form-data` package and its 4 dependencies.
- Removed `node-fetch` (still installed as a dev package)
- [MessageAttachment](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment) and [MessageAttachment.setFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment?scrollTo=setFile) now accept a `Blob` parameter. 
- Likewise, [DataResolver.resolveFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFile) also accepts a Blob. It also returns a `Blob` now, whereas it used to return a `Buffer` or `ReadableStream`.
- [DataResolver.resolveBase64](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveBase64) now returns `Promise<string>`.
- [DataResolver.resolveFileAsBuffer](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFileAsBuffer) is no longer used anywhere in the code, so like previously unused utility functions, will likely get removed in v14 (if this pr lands).

Complete list of changes:
- Removed `@discordjs/form-data` package and its 4 dependencies.
- Removed `node-fetch` (still installed as a dev package)
- [MessageAttachment](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment) and [MessageAttachment.setFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/MessageAttachment?scrollTo=setFile) now accept a `Blob` parameter. 
- Likewise, [DataResolver.resolveFile](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFile) also accepts a Blob. It also returns a `Blob` now, whereas it used to return a `Buffer` or `ReadableStream`.
- [DataResolver.resolveBase64](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveBase64) now returns `Promise<string>`.
- [DataResolver.resolveFileAsBuffer](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/DataResolver?scrollTo=s-resolveFileAsBuffer) is no longer used anywhere in the code, so like previously unused utility functions, will likely get removed in v14 (if this pr lands).
- The library now requires Node >=16.7.0 (bumped from Node >=16.6.0)

edit: I've been personally using this on my bot (roughly 21,000 members) that has made thousands of http requests and there has been no issue. This PR is likely ready for production use if anyone reading this wants to try it out. ;)

This PR adds strong typings to Audit Logs. For example, you could fetch them with a type like this:
```ts
const logs1 = await guild.fetchAuditLogs({ type: 'MEMBER_UPDATE' });
// > logs1.target => User
// > logs1.extra => null

const logs2 = await guild.fetchAuditLogs({ type: 'STAGE_INSTANCE_CREATE' });
// > logs2.target => StageInstance
// > logs2.extra => GuildChannel | { id: Snowflake }

// etc.
```

**To think about before merging**

1. Currently, we don't allow `number`s anymore in `GuildAuditLogsFetchOptions.type` because it's not compatible with `GuildAuditLogsAction`.
We could fix that by creating a mapping from numbers to `GuildAuditLogsAction`.
This could be done easily but is not really clean. Tell me what you would prefer, this is why I've made this PR a draft (Crawl told me on discord we should keep numbers, because it would be a too big regression otherwise)

2. I chose to write the current code with generics rather than many interfaces out of simplicity. However, this means that the typing of `logs1` will be `GuildAuditLogs<""MEMBER_UPDATE"">`, and `logs1.entries.first()` will be `GuildAuditLogsEntry<""MEMBER_UPDATE"", ""UPDATE"", ""USER"">` (yeah...)

Tell me if this is a no-no and I should use interfaces instead (which implies more code, which will even be spread around the file if we keep the classes sorted)


As this is my first contribution to the library, don't refrain from suggesting how it could be improved or what I should maybe do differently. I'm happy to discuss! :)

**Status and versioning classification:**

- Code changes have been tested against the Discord API, or there are no code changes
- I know how to update typings and have done so, or typings don't need updating

This PR adds strong typings to Audit Logs. For example, you could fetch them with a type like this:
```ts
const logs1 = await guild.fetchAuditLogs({ type: 'MEMBER_UPDATE' });
// > logs1.target => User
// > logs1.extra => null

const logs2 = await guild.fetchAuditLogs({ type: 'STAGE_INSTANCE_CREATE' });
// > logs2.target => StageInstance
// > logs2.extra => GuildChannel | { id: Snowflake }

// etc.
```

**To think about before merging**

1. Currently, we don't allow `number`s anymore in `GuildAuditLogsFetchOptions.type` because it's not compatible with `GuildAuditLogsAction`.
We could fix that by creating a mapping from numbers to `GuildAuditLogsAction`.
This could be done easily but is not really clean. Tell me what you would prefer, this is why I've made this PR a draft (Crawl told me on discord we should keep numbers, because it would be a too big regression otherwise)

This PR changes the guildMemberUpdate event in a (hopefully) `semver: minor` way in order to emit it on user updates like Discord intends us to. The `USER_UPDATE` event will still be emitted on both the `GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE` and the `PRESENCE_UPDATE` gateway events, however we will not fire presenceUpdate events as presences do not exist on users like it was discussed [here](https://discord.com/channels/222078108977594368/682166281826598932/895689920667062323). There is only 1 possible issue with this which is that the events will fire when we don't have a user's flags cached and they have flags in reality. This is due to the fact that Discord does not send the `public_flags` property on startup and thus it doesn't get cached. The only alternative would be not to emit the event when the old flags are not present, however this would become an issue in scenarios where the first userUpdate received on a session is a flags update.

The `USER_UPDATE` event will still be emitted on both the `GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE` and the `PRESENCE_UPDATE` gateway events, however we will not fire presenceUpdate events as presences do not exist on users like it was discussed [here](https://discord.com/channels/222078108977594368/682166281826598932/895689920667062323). There is only 1 possible issue with this which is that the events will fire when we don't have a user's flags cached and they have flags in reality. This is due to the fact that Discord does not send the `public_flags` property on startup and thus it doesn't get cached. The only alternative would be not to emit the event when the old flags are not present, however this would become an issue in scenarios where the first userUpdate received on a session is a flags update.

If we apply your suggestion, `old.user` will already be updated by the time it gets to `guildMemberUpdate` because `presenceUpdate` always seems to fire first (at least from our tests) which then emits a `userUpdate` and modifies the `user` object.

Even if a user doesn't have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent, your suggestion would still only work for the first guild that receives the update and not the ones that come after it (when the user is in more than 1 guild).

Hence why we now `._clone()` the `user` objects to fully detach them from eachother.

1. You can have properties set on option types that don't support them (e.g. channelTypes or required in subcommands) and by doing so, you're defining a property that can't and will never be set under any circumstance, which can also be seen as a bug by many people.
2. We never say that passing an explicit undefined is allowed, and neither do Discord's API docs. While yes we could change this, it doesn't make sense to do so in my eyes and this is not something that is usually done across the library. When things are marked as nullable (which none of these properties are) they usually accept null in order to reset said property, which is not the case here.

As for the issue regarding object mutation, I don't think we need to worry about that in this case, since you always need to fetch ApplicationCommand's in order to obtain their data and this is rarely done, meaning that a command's options will not be changing that often and, if they do, it won't be that big of a performance hit because it's not something ran as often as a channel patch method for example.
I was also not aware of the linked PR but it seems like the solution proposed there is even more resource-intensive as it first sets the properties and then deletes the ones that are undefined.

I also discussed this with @vladfrangu before creating the PR and he said this was an oversight and should be fixed (read the conversation [https://canary.discord.com/channels/222078108977594368/682166281826598932/896030558151397407](here)).

The problem was that the manual call to the handler was running side-by-side with the payload received from Discord, resulting in the event firing twice (and the cache check being redundant). In this case, I added a new parameter called `fromStructure` to the handler (which is called only from the structure) and removed the existing cache check! This should return the object instead of firing the event when called from the structure and will allow the object to be received without firing the event, which in turn will let the event be fired only from a payload received from Discord.

This should resolve #5063.

The problem was that the manual call to the handler was running side-by-side with the payload received from Discord, resulting in the event firing twice (and the cache check being redundant). In this case, I added a new parameter called `fromStructure` to the handler (which is called only from the structure) and removed the existing cache check! This should return the object instead of firing the event when called from the structure and will allow the object to be received without firing the event, which in turn will let the event be fired only from a payload received from Discord.

All these checks should be fine because we sent them across ourselves:

This check is kind of redundant in the scope of acting upon a partial message. If we're subscribing to partial messages, `.getMessage()` would return a partial message. If we're not, we don't receive one.

Breaking changes ahead:

Because slash commands used to be the only type of ""command"" our typeguards currently have some awkward names. For example `isCommand()` only means a chat input command. This is confusing because a command could be either a chat input command or a context menu command. To get around this recently yet another typeguard was introduced: `#isApplicationCommand`. While this was obviously done to get around making breaking changes, this makes things worse for the naming situation as the differences between `isApplicationCommand` and `isCommand` aren't very obvious.

Instead the interaction typeguards are now renamed to tell exactly *which kind* of command it narrows down to. Or in the case of `#isCommand`, it represents any kind of application command.

This also renames command interaction classes to be more idiomatic to the discord api naming,

Adds `Message#inGuild` to tell if a message was sent in a guild or not.

Also allows interactions to dictate if messages returned by it are cached or not for example:

```ts
if (interaction.inCachedGuild()) {
      const msg = await interaction.reply({ fetchReply: true });
     
      // btn narrowed to cached message component interaction.
      const btn = await msg.awaitMessageComponent({ componentType: 'BUTTON' });

     // Reply is of type `Message`
      const reply = await btn.reply({ content: 'test', fetchReply: true });
}
